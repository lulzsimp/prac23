    <p>Independence Day is celebrated annually on 15 August as a public holiday in India commemorating the nation's
      independence from the United Kingdom on 15 August 1947, the day when the provisions of the Indian Independence
      Act,
      which transferred legislative sovereignty to the Indian Constituent Assembly, came into effect. India retained
      King
      George VI as head of state until its transition to a republic, when the Constitution of India came into effect on
      26
      January 1950 (celebrated as Indian Republic Day) and replaced the dominion prefix, Dominion of India, with the
      enactment of the sovereign law Constitution of India. India attained independence following the independence
      movement noted for largely non-violent resistance and civil disobedience led by Indian National Congress under the
      leadership of Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
